# BurgerApp

## Description
A simple app which utilizes an SQL server. The user is able to add an item to a list of "not devoured burgers" through an input at the bottom of the page. Every item in this list has a button which says "Eat" which when clicked will add the item to another list called "devoured". The list is updated on the user's page and the database which the page is connected to is updated so the change persists.
